## Description.
The html and CSS presented to me displayed an apealing website but the code istelf was not efficient and could create problems in future iterations.  There were also no alt tags for any of the images and the links in the header were broke. 

For this project I began by looking at the html and replaced all or most of the "divs" with more appropriate semantics. I took the first "div" and turned it into the "header" (classifying a "div" as a "header" is verbose). I removed the next "div" and replaced it with "nav". I also thought it was a bit cleaner to remove the "ul" and simply listed the "a" elements as such within the "nav" element. These changes took care of the "header". 

So I moved on to the next part of the "body". Here I I took the hero "div" and turned it into a "figure" which seemd to be logical and would keep it semantically separate from the next section. 

After the "figure" I changed the next set of "div"s into the "main" with three "section"s. Each of the sections recieved an "id".

Following the "main" section I took the following "divs" and made them an "aside". I renamed the clustered "divs" within the "aside" as "sections"

Then I made the final "div" into the "footer".


For the CSS I did consolidate a lot. To be honest, I broke it at first and had to go back and fix things that I broke. For example, the section that I had labeled as the aside would not align with the top of the section to its left. It kept aligning with the bottom most part of that section. Then I went to class and we talked about positioning and I didn't understand that very well but tried to work with it and was able to get it looking good again. But that took a lot of time.
